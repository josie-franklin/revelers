          Events marked "Private" are closed events not open to the public and
          no additional information will be available. Public events will be so
          marked and further details about ticketing and other information will
          be posted when available. TBA means the band has been booked but other
          details are pending. <br />
          As many of you know the Pittsboro Roadhouse has permanently closed. We
          salute the staff and management and wish them all well. Thanks also to
          our wonderful fans for the great times we enjoyed there.. We are
          performing live shows again in new places and hope you all can join us
          soon!

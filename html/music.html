        <p class="margin-top">
          Our mix of standards from the great american songbook, plus samples of
          more contemporary material is sure to please your guests while
          creating memories that will stand the test of time. For a sample of
          the type of show we play follow this link to our "Grove Park" page
          which gives some details about our perfomances at Asheville's
          magnificient Omni Grove Park Inn. The NC Revelers Orchestra, while
          featuring the best music of the Big Band Era, carries that tradition
          to the present day with newer tunes from the ensuing years that lend
          themselves to the instrumentation of the classic Big Band. We play
          newer material from the likes of Harry Connick and Michael Buble'
          right along with the more traditional big band fare associated with
          Glenn Miller or Frank Sinatra. Show tunes are of necessity a large
          part of our presentation and we play the best of the best. Our library
          includes tunes from Broadway, sambas, cha-chas, beguines, tangos and
          waltzes among others right along with classic tunes from the beach and
          rock songbooks. We constantly seek new music to offer our listeners.
          We will constantly add new material as we find it. If you have a
          favorite you'd like to see us add to our repertoire, please let us
          know. It's probably available somewhere "out there," and we'll be
          happy to add it when and if we are able to find it.

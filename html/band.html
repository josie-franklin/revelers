        <h1>The Band</h1>
        <p class="margin-top">
          The NC Revelers Orchestra, is a show and dance band in the tradition
          of the great touring bands of Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Les Brown and
          others. Our musicians are some of North Carolina's finest and our
          mission is to bring the best of the great american songbook of popular
          show and dance tunes to new audiences. We are most at home performing
          for special events and we will be very interested in performing for
          yours. We have an extensive library of show and dance tunes to please
          every audience. We specialize in weddings,dances, fundraisers,
          conventions, concerts and any other event where a big band might be
          expected to provide the entertainment. Our vocalist Mr Kelly Smith
          (right, below) sings the songs you remember. and does so with a
          style,and competence which dazzles our audiences. The effort put forth
          by every single member of this group, whether singers, musicians,
          rehearsal conductor or set-up crew, is professional in every way and
          is the expression of many years of musical training and experience.
          Each of us spends his or her days in one professional capacity or
          another although not all of us depend on music for a living. The music
          is our outlet, indeed for most of us, our passion. We rehearse every
          week year round and many engage in daily private practice to maintain
          the skills necessary to play this wonderful music. Our members are
          professional musicians from throughout Central North Carolina, mostly
          in the Research Triangle,and Raleigh / Durham areas. Many of our
          players hold music degrees and all are trained to the professional
          performance level and have vast experience in the Jazz Orchestra and
          dance band fields. The band is rehearsed weekly to iron out the fine
          details and is not a pickup band in any sense of the word. <br />

          How it all happened... Prior to his move to North Carolina in 2006,
          Henry Mason led Atlanta's "Sentimental Journey Orchestra", a regional
          dance orchestra with a national reputation as one of the best of
          modern day "Territory Bands". SJO has been in continuous operation for
          over four decades and has played all over the mid south. During
          Henry's term as bandleader of SJO, the band played for some very
          interesting venues and people. Noteworthy among those were Ted
          Turner's birthday party, President Jimmy Carter's Nobel Peace Prize
          celebration in Georgia and the 75th Anniversary party for Atlanta's
          Fabulous Fox Theater among many others. The focus was always on high
          quality music and professionalism worthy of the legacy of the great
          road bands of the forties and fifties that defined the term "Big
          Band". Professionalism in the manner of the great bands did not
          however mean standing still or overplaying the "nostalgia card". It
          meant a big band that is modern in every way, playing great music from
          all eras but with the professional standards that the great '40's
          bands were famous for. Atlanta was getting too big, with 24 hour
          traffic jams, and the kids and grandkids had moved to Raleigh. It was
          an easy decision to move to North Carolina and maybe just get to play
          on a band somewhere without the joys and responsibilities of
          bandleading. Musical involvement came quickly with opportunities to
          substitute on local dance bands and concert Jazz orchestras. There was
          certainly no dissatisfaction with any of these fine musical groups,
          but after booking and running the show for so many years... it was
          time to start another band, drawing on those years of experience ....
          and just possibly, North Carolina audiences would enjoy a band with
          the same musical ideals and professionalism that made SJO such a long
          running hit in Atlanta. You may rest assured that the music will be
          authentic to the best of our ability and no corners will be cut. That
          means a full big band and the best music we can find. Why the
          Revelers? As to how the name came about, Henry says "My late
          father-in-law who at 87 was still one of the youngest people I ever
          met, once belonged to a social club of equally young folks called "The
          Revelers". I promised him a full band for his party if he made it to
          100. Since he didn't quite make it, the band name serves as my salute
          to his outlook on life." A revel is a large and boisterous special
          event. The NC Revelers are a big and boisterous special band for
          special events. We will be happy to play for your revel and you are
          invited to call us about it.

          I have been actively involved in the Triangle Swing Scene since 2000.
          I have seen some good bands and I have seen some that were quite
          awful. I can say without exaggeration that the NC Revelers are a GREAT
          band. They have a clean, tight sound and they really know how to send
          it. So if you are looking for a band to dance to or one to relax with,
          the NC Revelers are the band for you! Paul Cwik Garner, NC Hey Henry!
          Thank you and the rest of the NCRO for playing at our Charity Ball!
          The professional quality of the performance really added to the
          success of the overall event, and was extremely well-received by our
          guests. We really enjoyed the variety of the music that the orchestra
          played, from salsa to swing dancing to slow tunes, which both the
          younger guests and adults had a lot of fun dancing to. The vocalists
          also sounded amazing. Many of the guests came up to me afterwards to
          tell me how much they had enjoyed the band more than any previous
          year, and that this was the most fun they'd ever had dancing at
          Charity Ball. Thank you for also providing a sound man during breaks,
          it helped the night to run smoothly. Thank you so much for
          contributing to the success of this event! We really appreciate how
          much it improved everyone's experience at our Charity Ball. Lilly
          (School Charity Ball Organizer) Raleigh NC Wow! I feel sorry for
          anyone who did not go to the NC Revelers gig yesterday. It was
          fantastic. The vocalists were superb. Thanks for bringing them here. I
          hope you have a spring concert in mind. Thomas H. Wilson NC Gentlemen
          of the NC Revelers Orchestra, I write to convey a huge thank you for
          your excellent performance at the Fike Auditorium in December. Your
          high performance standards displayed throughout the concert were very
          impressive, and the song selection varied enough to please anyone!
          Bravo and well done to all the band members! My family and I enjoyed
          the concert immensely and look forward to the Orchestraâ€™s return to
          Wilson. Karen N. Wilson NC "We had fun with the band in Wilson. There
          was music for all ages YOUNG and OLD.. Listen to the music, clap your
          hands, get up and dance, dance, dance, or just relax to the music." M.
          Jones Henry, we just wanted to drop a note thanking you for the bands
          great contribution to our party last month. I thought the mix and
          quality of songs were excellent. Both vocalists were high quality. All
          of our guests were complimentary about the band's performance and
          thought the music added significantly to their enjoyment of the
          evening. We would love to have you back anytime and felt lucky to have
          found your blossoming group. We have become big fans and wish you the
          best in all your future endeavors . David (private event client) All
          who were present will confirm that it was an event not to be missed...
          I was no more prepared than anyone else there for the outstanding
          quality of the N.C. Revelers! I have heard jazz and swing ensembles
          all over the world. I have not heard better anywhere! The concert was
          absolutely UPTOWN! Solo vocalist Lauren Meehan is more than a
          beautiful girl with a beautiful voice; she is an expert jazz stylist -
          complete with skill in the elusive art of "scat". Her "Over the
          Rainbow" was absolutely exquisite Ken (Church Event client)

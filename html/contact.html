          with caller ID blocked, although you will get voicemail. If you leave
          a message we WILL return your call. If you don't block your phone
          number, you may well get through to a human!

          Musicians who enjoy playing in big bands are always needed! A big band
          requires a large pool of musicians in addition to regular members. A
          large band frequently requires substitute performers when a member has
          a schedule conflict with work or family or occasional illness. If you
          are a musician who plays one of the instruments found in a big band,
          Sax (Clarinet and flute doubles preferred), Trumpet, Trombone or one
          of the Rhythm instruments, give us a call and schedule sitting in with
          the band with an eye to getting on the sub list. Subs who help with
          rehearsals automatically go to the head of the call list when we need
          someone on a performance.

          Why a big band? If you have a vivid memory of a wedding reception you
          have attended it is because it was special in some way. Most
          receptions are essentially forgotten the next day so if one stands out
          there is usually a good reason. If one reception stands apart from the
          others it usually is because the entertainment was something special
          or different. A wedding reception with the cool, jazzy sounds of the
          golden era of Hollywood or Las Vegas will be memorable for all time
          The NC Revelers Orchestra will set your reception apart in the
          memories of your guests with classic romantic melodies that everyone
          loves, as well as show and dance tunes that complement the
          celebration. Live Music IS Important A live orchestra presents music
          made by people and the sense of entertainment is immediate and
          personal. There is interaction with the audience and your guests feel
          that they are part of the celebration instead of just being
          spectators. The guests tend to stay around longer as the presentation
          is ever changing and interesting. With live music, the presentation is
          exciting and the memory of your event will stand for a lifetime as
          something special and something different from every other wedding. A
          Big Band plays to a broad variety of musical tastes with an almost
          infinite variety of tonal color. With everything from popular Swing
          Classics, Beach Tunes, Waltzes, Latin in all styles and you have an
          incomparable variety that hard to beat. A big band is special,
          impressive and different and has music for every generation present.
          The music will stand out in your guest's memories long after the last
          note is played. Weddings are all about memories and a full sized dance
          orchestra sets your event apart in ways that smaller ensembles simply
          cannot match. Impressive We should point out that a full sized big
          band is an impressive sight. We bring our own staging which fits us
          neatly into the same space a normal sized rock band would take up.
          With our custom music stands and tuxedo clad musicians, a big band
          does look like Hollywood, Vegas or Manhattan has come to town. If you
          are pulling out the stops to put on a major event, a full orchestra
          enhances the atmosphere of "Class Act" in a very memorable way.

          A variety concert from the NC Revelers will give you a tour of the
          great American songbook right up to the present day. We have
          contemporary tunes and music from current popular performers as well
          as the best of material from the classic big band era. If you are
          looking for the sounds of a classic 1940's Big Band, we can deliver a
          40's concert with the best. We have original scores from the great
          bands and our players know the style inside out. We can also broaden
          our approach to the great show bands of the 1950's and later such as
          the great Count Basie sound with Frank Sinatra or the oustanding Billy
          May Orchestra with Bobby Darin. We are also at home with more
          contemporary tunes in the styles of Michael Bublé and Harry Connick
          Jr. Our concert show can represent a great value as an integral part
          of your event or as a stand alone performance for fund raisers or
          cultural occasions.

          Conventions gather people from all over who share a common occupation
          or interest. Not only is it important to get attendees involved in the
          event, but it is equally important for the event to be memorable
          enough that your message will remain long after the convention closes.
          Frequently an opening or closing dinner dance is just the thing to get
          your message across with style and distinction. Our Big Band fits
          corporate events very well and adds that touch of the golden days of
          Vegas and Hollywood to your party that everyone will remember. Contact
          us with your needs and we will show you how our presentation can
          enhance yours and extend your message with classic music from the
          Great American Songbook as well as contemporary material that will
          keep all of your attendees engaged. If you are hosting a large event,
          a big band is very much at home in large convention spaces. We have
          our own extensive sound system, can provide microphones for your use
          during band breaks and our size is an advantage where impressive
          presentations count. The bold sound of a full orchestra will really
          set your event apart and add great emphasis to your message. Your
          attendees will go home with strong memories of the event that will
          make your business or cause stand out for the right reasons.

          An evening with the NC Revelers Orchestra evokes the sounds and styles
          of the great road orchestras of the past melded with the popular music
          of today. You will find yourself musically transported to the intimate
          showrooms of the Las Vegas "Rat Pack" days or one of the great
          Manhattan supper clubs. NCRO will make your special event stand out in
          ways that will make your guests wish the evening would not end and
          remember your event as outstanding in a very positive way. If you are
          hosting an event with numerous patrons, our big band is very much at
          home in a large hall (for example the Raleigh Convention Center) and
          has sound equipment for large rooms. The bold sound of a full
          orchestra will really set your event apart and add great emphasis to
          your message. The NC Revelers Orchestra has played numerous fund
          raiser events including the Rex Hospital Gala (two times) and other
          church and children's charity events. All were very successful with
          one church mortgage retired with the proceeds of one event. Other
          events include three different visits to the famed Grove Park Inn for
          "Big Band Weekend". We have also done school concerts and have strong
          ties with the music education community. NCRO supports special causes
          with special rates. Contact us for more information.

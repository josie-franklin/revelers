          How do I book the band? How much does it cost and how much space do
          you need? The NC Revelers are a great choice to bring excitement and a
          memorable difference to your next event. We provide quality
          entertainment for your party, adding an element of "showbiz" usually
          associated with the heyday of Hollywood or Las Vegas. Wedding
          receptions, fundraising events, special dances, conventions, trade
          shows, private parties, concerts...you name it, we can handle it. If
          your event is something we are not a good fit for we will tell you up
          front and try to assist you in finding the entertainment you need. As
          to space we usually ask for a 24 x 24 foot stage area, but in general
          we can fit anywhere a normal sized rock band fits. Our equipment is
          different but takes up no more room. We have had a lot of practice
          fitting where we need to be. For details on booking call Henry and he
          will set everything up for you and answer any questions. In general we
          cost no more than many rock bands or specialized wedding bands. It is
          a good idea to plan as far ahead as you can. Popular dates (Christmas,
          New Year's Eve, Valentines Day, etc.) can book pretty early. Securing
          a confirmed booking date now will prevent disappointment. Events are
          booked most often for two, three or four-hour events (this includes
          one customary break per hour). Most concert performances are two
          hours. Prices are based on the specific times and needs of your event.
          If the proposed performance venue is located more than two hour's
          driving time from Raleigh, there may be a surcharge for transportation
          (bus rental) and/or overnight accommodations. We will be happy to
          quote a definite price as soon as we know the exact requirements of
          the engagement (how long, how far, etc.).

          Our band setup is the same as that of the great road orchestras of Les
          Brown, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller and Count Basie. While smaller bands
          can play the same tunes, we strive for the depth and clarity that only
          full classic Big Band instrumentation can provide. The space
          requirements for a full band are essentially identical to those of a
          "cut down" 12 or 14 piece band. We feel that this wonderful music
          deserves to be played by the instrumentation it was written for with
          no corners cut even if it means we make a few dollars less for doing
          it right. We always have one vocalist and usually two in addition to
          the full band. We provide our own sound system and customized band
          equipment. Here are the physical requirements:
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/setup2.jpg" />
        <p>
          There are two basic configurations. Normally the band prefers to set
          up in three rows in a 24 foot square area. In some venues an optional
          wide setup may be necessary and the requirement for this is 36 feet
          wide but only 16 feet deep. Our set-up crew must have access to the
          performance site at least two hours prior to the event, and for at
          least two hours after the event for removal of our equipment and
          staging.

          Successful Event Planning Most members of The NC Revelers have worked
          in providing music for special events for years. We have performed for
          just about every type of public and private event you can imagine.
          From small private parties to huge conventions, we have just about
          seen it all, including a president and a few governors. Many of these
          events have been carefully and even professionally planned but mixed
          in with those is the occasional "train wreck" . Since many people only
          plan one or a few big events in a lifetime, We thought we would
          summarize some of our hard won experience in our part of of the
          entertainment business for your use. It may not be everything you
          need, but it will give you a few things to consider as you start the
          planning process. Advance Planning If you are planning a large big
          event like a fund raiser or corporate , we suggest putting together a
          committee to plan your event starting at least 6 months and preferably
          a year ahead. This is particularly true of reunions where it may take
          some time to track down all the potential guests. Decide on the time
          of year and survey what else is going on in that time period. With
          only 52 weekends in a year, some already taken by holidays, there are
          a limited number of potential dates. While some conflicts are
          inevitable, careful consideration and a "save the date" card to your
          potential guest list will make a big difference especially your top
          contributors in the case of fund raisers. These are usually the
          businest people and you want them to know about your event first. We
          should mention here that if you plan for people to pay money to come
          to your event, whatever the cause, live music is very important. While
          there are some very nice people in the DJ business, a top flight event
          is not the sort of gathering one usually associates with a DJ, and
          that includes those with the big out of town reputation. Basically a
          DJ is going to amplify his music to the point of ear pain, which
          prevents conversation. The very people you are trying to get to
          contribute will be the ones leaving after dinner with a headache. In
          the case of a wedding, people who have traveled many miles to honor
          the wedding party cannot communicate across a table. Live music is not
          only music but also entertainment. While a big band can play loudly,
          there are frequent soft passages for contrast and the various
          combinations give color and interest to the music. Conversation is not
          only possible but there is something visually interesting happening to
          talk about. Funding The budget for your event is an important
          consideration. Decide how much you need to spend to get the event off
          the ground. This should include ballroom rental, food, decorating and
          of course the entertainment which we naturally suggest should be US.
          Also to be considered are minor rentals, catering and bartenders,
          advertising and ticket printing. Large family events such as weddings
          frequently require almost as much effort as a large corporate event.
          If you don't have a staff to draw from, at least make extensive lists
          of what you will need and draw up a timetable for getting everything
          in place. Theme Events Is there a Theme for the event? This is the
          focus of your party. Some suggestions: Cabaret night, Hollywood Ball,
          Las Vegas Show, USO show,Fitzgerald Follies, Capone's Speakeasy,
          Casino night etc. The idea is to come up with a theme that your
          potential attendees will find glamorous and entertaining. Some people
          even extend the "theme" idea into very large weddings. If you do this
          remember any family sensitivities or concerns. Location, Location,
          Location! Reserve the hall. Good ones are booked far in advance. Don't
          wait and find out you have no place for the party. The hall should
          suit the theme, you don't want a 21st century theme in a 1930's hotel,
          nor do you want to book a cabaret dance in a glass tower if you can
          help it. Decoration can make up for this, but walking to an old
          mansion ballroom adds a LOT to a theme based on F. Scott Fitzgerald.
          As part of this you need to make sure you have enough room for the
          projected attendance as well as service, seating and the Orchestra.
          Book The Band It is not a good idea to splurge for the food and skimp
          on the entertainment. Next year, guess what your audience will
          remember? Will it be the food and flowers or the best musical
          entertainment they had heard in years? The best bands are not cheap
          and you are more likely to have a successful event. Of course we
          suggest the NC Revelers Orchestra which will give you more show for
          your money than any other. Catering Contract with your caterer for
          food service. You may wish to obtain bids from several reputable
          caterers. Needless to say the better ones are as busy as the best
          bands. Many of them can help you with decorations and other
          necessities and sometimes they know about halls or bands. Tips From
          Experience No matter what your decorator tells you do not separate the
          band from the dance floor! If you do,the band loses communication with
          the audience and becomes a jukebox. Make sure the dancers are right in
          front of the band. Also speaking of decorators, remind yours that the
          band will need to USE the bandstand and that there must be room for
          the band AND its equipment and lighting. All of this should be
          coordinated with the entertainment and planned for and incorporated
          into the "vision" for the event. We have seen more than one decorator
          become upset at necessary changes to allow the band to do its job,
          such as potted plants being moved in favor of necessary lighting or
          sound equipment. It is always better to work together from the
          beginning than have disputes arise the day of the event. We will be
          happy to work with you to see that your event and our part of it goes
          smoothly. Make sure your hall is the right size for the event. If you
          have a hall for 1000 and have 200 at your party they will spread to
          the walls and will not enjoy themselves. The best parties are held in
          a hall with no more seats than people. Just ask the social chairman of
          any fraternity or sorority. In larger rooms it is a good idea to set
          the room with tables layered very near the dance floor and place the
          bar and food in back so that traffic to the bar and food service does
          not cross the dance floor. This helps concentrate the guests near the
          entertainment and as the audience fades near the end of the evening,
          the dance area is still concentrated and the remaining guests have a
          much better time. Publicity Publicity is a big key to a successful
          event. In general, ten people need to be aware of the event for every
          one ticket sold. Keep your ticket prices fairly reasonable unless you
          are really going for "exclusive". If a thousand people attend this
          year and it's a success two thousand will WANT to attend next year and
          you can raise prices. The same reasoning applies between one hundred
          and two hundred attendees. If you need help with publicity we can
          advise you on the basics as well as provide contact information to
          professionals who can help you. You may wish to provide a "wind down"
          time near the end of the event and serve coffee after the bar closes.
          There is a great emphasis on "designated drivers" these days and
          promotion of the safety of your guests is important. If you have a
          program other than dancing, make sure it starts at a normal band break
          time unless you need the band to particpate.The NC Revelers Orchestra
          can provide fanfares, short marches and other musical "fills" for a
          program if this is coordinated in advance. Coordination of scheduled
          activities is particulary important at weddings where there are toasts
          and speeches. This can be helpful for several reasons. Not only do you
          get the maximum music from a live orchestra, but tight scheduling can
          prevent "Uncle Fred" from monopolizing the microphone and turning a
          simple toast into an unwanted marathon speech.

          How long should my reception last? We recommend about three hours
          although four hour receptions are fairly common. We see very few
          longer than four hours. The first hour will be taken up by the band
          entertaining your guests while you are finishing up with pictures. The
          second hour for the dances with father and mother and the all
          important cutting of the cake. Band breaks are an ideal time for
          speeches and testimonials and we will of course give you a great
          fanfare for a toast at any time. If you go for a three hour event,
          just limit the length and number of the speeches! <br />
          I plan a traditional reception with many well known wedding
          conventions, how would your music fit into our plans? Important
          considerations would be music for:Bride and Groom entrance into
          reception.Bride's first dance with her new husband as Mr. & Mrs.
          Bride's dance with father and father-in-law. Fanfare for Cake Cutting,
          a Drumroll/fanfare for bouquet toss and if you are observing the
          garter toss tradition we have a handy short version of "The Stripper"
          for that too! We also can provide special music for ethnic traditions
          if desired. <br />
          Do you have suggested songs for the First Dance? Slow tunes that have
          stood the test of time include Glenn Miller's "Moonlight Serenade",
          Carmichaels's "Star Dust" "The Nearness of You".We also have a good
          selection of more recent rock style tunes if you prefer something
          contemporary. Faster tunes could include: "The Best is Yet to Come",
          "Fly Me to the Moon" or "The Way You Look Tonight".These are a few
          among hundreds, including some contemporary tunes. If you wish special
          music, we can obtain or arrange most any special tune. There may be a
          charge for custom arranging but usually we can find the tunes you
          want. <br />
          Will you hold a date while I decide on the music? We will take an
          inquiry on your date and call you if another call on the date comes
          in. At that point, a decision will be needed immediately along with a
          deposit and signed contract if you wish to reserve the date. Our
          advice is to contract for your musical entertainment as soon as you
          book the hall for your reception. Remember that particularly in the
          Spring and Summer, there are many weddings and only about sixteen or
          so ideal dates. Call the NC Revelers Orchestra at 919-847-2263 today
          to book a lifetime of memories for your wedding, anniversary or other
          special event.
